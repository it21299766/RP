## 🎯 Problem Statement

Universities worldwide face significant operational inefficiencies:

- **Class & Exam Scheduling:** Rigid systems leading to suboptimal room utilization and timetable clashes
- **Staff Workload Distribution:** Imbalanced assignments resulting in overburdened staff and reduced productivity
- **Laboratory/Resource Utilization:** Under-utilized or over-subscribed facilities due to poor management
- **Transport Management:** Inefficient shuttle routes and vehicle usage, increasing costs and environmental impact

**Impact:** Wasted resources, overburdened staff, and dissatisfied students.
